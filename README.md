The task involves creating two types of agents, `TaxiAgent` and `OptimalTaxiAgent`, to operate in a taxi simulation environment. The environment consists of a grid, passengers with changing goals, limited actions, and scoring rules. The goal is to maximize points by delivering passengers and taking actions optimally.

What we did:
- We understood the environment's properties, rules, and scoring.
- Designed Python classes for `TaxiAgent` and `OptimalTaxiAgent`.
- Implemented the `act` method in each class to make decisions based on the current state.
- Considered factors such as taxi and passenger locations, available actions, and goals when designing agent strategies.
